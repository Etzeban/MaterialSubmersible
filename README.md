<h1>Material design for a submersible</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Being project manager of a team of 5 students and responsible for ensured the project aligned with the project requirements, material analysis, research on manufacturing process of the submersible's hull, and writing report.
<br />
Our job is to come up with suitable material design for the application: the material for the submersiblethat can work up to 2000 meters under water. The following requirements should be addressed:
<br />
1. Perform an analysis of the set of environmental data such that you can refine theenvironmental challenges into a set of quantifiable data. You may want to do someresearch on the actual conditions on the USA.
<br />
2. Perform an analysis of the set of design requirements together with the environmentaldata above and examine their interactions.
<br />
3. Produce a set of engineering specification to serve as the basic of your material selectionsusing the analysis results from (1) and (2) above. The engineering specification should bespecific.
<br />
4. All diagrams, figures and tables should be accurately and clearly labeled with meaningfulnames and/or titles. When there are numerous pages of computer-generated data, it ispreferable to put this information in an appendix with an explanation in the report narrative.
<br />
5. Material Fitness Analysis: list the process with which you used to select the best 3candidates for the application. Each step of the selection process should be noted accompanied with the appropriate diagram and explanation. At the end of this section,you should identify 3 most suitable materials for each application (if you cannot find 3,provide the reason). Your selection should identify the prime candidate for eachapplication and explain your choice using the materialâ€™s atomic structure, physical properties, etc.
<br />
6. Manufacturing and Cost Analysis: Provide the manufacturing recommendations(operation, tooling, etc.) to mass produce and its estimated part cost with respect to eachcandidate material.
<br />
7. Performance Comparison & Recommendation: Provide a comparison matrix using thedata collected in Section 5 and Section 6 against the engineering specification you cameup in section 1-2-3. Highlight the benefit and the drawback for each selection and note your recommendation accordingly.
